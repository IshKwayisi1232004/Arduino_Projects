# S.O.S Signal README

In this project, my task was to develop code where for loops are prioritized in lighting up a set of LEDs. The loop can be catered to the your desires (no need to make yours loop over 3 times over with the same blinking pattern). 

Since this is the simplest project in the repository, I recommend for anyone who is beginning to learn Arduino to start here. Thats mostly because it teaches you basics in wiring, drawing power, and writing simple commands. If your coming from the world of Computer Science, think of this as your "Hello World!" program for working with Arduino.
