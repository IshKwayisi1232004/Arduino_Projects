# DC Motor README

In this project, I designed a DC motor to spin a fan in one direction for a few seconds, then wait 2 second and complete a set of spins for a few seconds in the opposiste direction. Under the condition that the algorithm loops indefinetly.

This small exercise is meant to teach the basics of a DC motor. A DV motor (Dircect Current Motor) converts electrical energy from a DC source into mechanical energy using magnetic fields. They mainly rely on the principle of a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field experiences force. Which initiates the rotation in the motor, controlled by omponents like armatures, stators, and commutators. One real world use of a DC Motor are electric vehicles, where the motor offers precise speed control and high torque.
